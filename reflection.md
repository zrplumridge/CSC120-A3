I talked through some issues and reviewed the assignment parameters with Joanna Li. I attended TA hours Tuesday 9/20 to get started and review Java. I had an issue with getting a JDK installed to even run the code but Suany Barahona helped in Slack and then we went over that in class. I attended TA hours Sunday 9/25, where I realized that I had made the problem more complex than necessary by trying to have multiple conversations each time the code was run. 

I have worked with Java before, although it's been a few years, and much of the syntax comes more naturally to me than Python. Creating methods takes more effort. It feels less concise because I have to define how much space an array will take up before I can put objects in the array. 

Order matters. A program can't use a variable or function before it's defined. Documentation is super helpful. 

I am finding Java harder to keep organized because I don't absolutely have to tab as in Python. This probably means that I should define more methods and maybe add more comments in addition to indentation. 

I kept forgetting to add to the array size when adding words to mirror, so there were a lot of errors from that. I also keep forgetting that I have some extension on to automatically close quotation marks, parthentheses, etc., so I double-type them, although I expect that I would miss more if I turned it off. I will just have to get used to that.
